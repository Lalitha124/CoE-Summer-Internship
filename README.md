#Medical Image Enhancement with Autoencoder

This repository contains a Python project that uses autoencoder models to enhance medical images. The project includes different versions of enhanced autoencoder architectures with techniques like residual connections and SSIM-based loss functions to improve model performance on image quality.

Project Overview :  
The main goal is to improve medical images' contrast, sharpness, and overall quality using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and autoencoder architectures. This project includes models with different configurations and optimizations, such as:

Enhanced Autoencoder with additional convolutional layers
SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) based loss function for improved image quality
Residual and Batch Normalization layers for deeper models
Optimizations with EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau to manage learning rates
